Trial Number is the Trialâ€™s absolute trial number; this specification can be in the form of a number or a trial variable expression.  The When parameter specifies when the trial should be re-run; the possible values are Mix and End. Mix specifies that the trial re-run should be mixed in with the remaining first-run trials, while End specifies that the re-run should be delayed until all of the first-runs are done. If a trial is re-run with End, the second-time re-runs will be performed after the first-time re-runs are complete.  The Arrange parameter specifies an order within the two When types; the possible values are Start, End, and Random. Start specifies that the trial should be re-run before any other trials currently scheduled for re-run in its set (Mix or End). End specifies that it should be re-run after the other re-run trials. Random specifies that it should be rescheduled at a random position within its re-run set."
